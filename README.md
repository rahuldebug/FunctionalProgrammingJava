[Functional Programming in JAVA]

    A method needs 4 things name ,
    return  type , input parameters and body

    int doStuff(int a){ 
    do stuff 
    return c; 
    }

    to implement SAM (single abstract method ) we don't need name,
    as we will be referring to only one method ,
    return type can always be inferred from body
    whether we are returning anything and what is its type
    so the above method can also be written as

    (int a)->{ do stuff return c;}

    this is nothing but lambda expression,
    it can only be employed for SAM (single abstract method )
    we will also go with difference between SAM and anonymous class.

[Four New Functional Interfaces]

    consumer
    * consumer consumes, and has no return type

    predicate
    * predicate return type is boolean

    supplier 
    *Supplies a particular type of object

    function
    * takes in one type and return another type

   


[Imperative and Declarative type of programming]

    imperative , we are writing our own logic , we are modifing objects , mutability is there 

   
[Method Reference]

    Powerful feature to refer to the method of the class
    example > Student::getName

[Stream Api]

    Stream Api is used for  data processing , 
    it can be considered as conveyer belt for proicessing 
    data , From collection stream is created 
    which then is used to process data in declarative way 
    - Intermediate Operations
      filter (predicate) , map(function) .
    - Terminal Operations
      Collectors.collect , sum , max , min etc
